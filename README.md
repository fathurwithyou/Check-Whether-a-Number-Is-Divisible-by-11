# Check-if-a-Number-is-Divisible-by-11

Hello guys, so I want to share my code to check if a number is divisible by 11 or not.
So, firstly you have to input t cases. Then input a number (n) at the end you give a white space.

FAQ:
Why don't you use modulo to check? 
Ans: How about if n >= 2^64 - 1? Can we check?
