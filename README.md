# Check Whether a Number Is Divisible by 11

Hello guys, so I want to share my code to check whether a number is divisible by 11.
So, firstly you have to input t cases. Then, input a number (n) at the end you give a white space.

FAQ:
Why don't you use modulo to check? 
Ans: How about if n >= 2^64 - 1? Could we check?
